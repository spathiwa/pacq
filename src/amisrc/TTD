PACQ - things to do:

Construction:

  Fix problem with context sensitive hot-keys (updating gadgets)
  Underline hot-letter for gadget key-activation
  Play maze from Construction set
  Option to load game file and index forward and backward through mazes
  Automatic-toggling of create gadget
  Option to change colors from construction set
  Print XY position
  Allow connection of non-tunnel-edge to tunnel-edge
  auto-locate problems (IE looks different that what it is) (? hard ?)
  Move horizontal edge up/down & vert edge left/right (? hard ?)
  Mirror option for construction (? hard ?)
  Draw solid lines on all edges, then erase where dots should be
   ^ This won't work because dots are read for feedback...
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Fix problem with confusion of filenames when saving - make program wise
* Fix problem with menu getting pushed too far down
* Don't allow an edge to be dragged off the screen
* Automatic resizing of screen
* Add RxOffset and RyOffset to x/y values
* Do not allow add vertex when starting outside of min/max x/y
* Superbitmap Construction
* Add delete/backspace to delete an edge
* Fix Ghost-box crash
* Make default maze and vars if no maze has been loaded

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Game:

  Fix problem with white pacman at end
  Make a program to convert ASCII -> binary images for sprites
  Animated ghosts
  Leave PAC on for a while & blink maze when finished
  Implement above as two separate tasks
  Add high score list to the title screen
  Add gadgets for play, about, construct, and quit
  Add timer support for score per minute & overall time
  Make "About" gadget in construction and allows credits in mazes
  Modify to eliminate "need" for var file by implmenting commands in
    game file.  Suggested commands:
    "loadmaze mazename {0/left/right/up/down}"
    "loadvars varname"
    "set <varname> = parameter_value"
    "playgame"
    "label:"
    "goto label"
  Push button for stair-stepping automatic movement on corners
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Make eyes same speed in tunnels
* Allow ghosts follow pacman in tunnels (without 'heading him off')
* Make keyboard remember all keys down but only signal last button pressed
* Fix problem where ghosts go in circles when in random mode
* Make a program to convert binary -> ASCII images for sprites
* Prevent pacman from eating outside of max/min x/y
* Fix problem in custom5 maze where no_ghost isn't working.
* Change the speed of the background noise as numdots--
* Fix bug where orange ghost gets stuck in ghost_1way
* Allow keyboard control
* Fix problem where ghosts go fast in box when DeEnergizing
* Erase sprite pointer when playing game

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Misc:
  Finish readme file
  Have intro screen/animation:
    Maybe use MsPacman type "starring blah blah"
    Maybe use special blitter stuff
    Maybe use 3-d something or another
